# 2025-11-19 — CLI Training Mode Improvements

## Context
- Working on Project Chimera CLI (`main.py`) and training workflow.

## Changes
- Added a `--training-file` / `-T` argument to the `process-data` command so training runs can explicitly target a chosen CSV.
- Wired `--training-file` to override `--input` when `--mode training` is selected, with a warning if used in any other mode.
- Updated CLI epilog examples in `main.py` to show how to run:
  - `uv run main.py process-data --mode training --training-file data/raw/dataframes/test_final.csv`
- Updated `README.md` to document the new flag in both the quick-start examples and the CLI reference.

## Rationale
- Makes it explicit which dataset is used during training runs instead of relying only on auto-detection or `--input`.
- Reduces friction when iterating on multiple candidate training files (e.g., `test_final.csv`, alternate samples).

## Next Ideas
- Add a small section in the docs describing recommended naming/versioning conventions for training datasets.
- Consider a `--config` option for saving common training setups (file, mode, output path) for quick reuse.
