Volume by Price (VBP) Chart Data Fetcher Module.

This module provides functionality to fetch and process Volume by Price (VBP) chart data
from Sierra Chart using the trade29 SC bridge. The module contains the GetVbpData class
which handles the connection to Sierra Chart, data retrieval, and processing of VBP data
into structured pandas DataFrames.

Volume by Price (VBP) data shows the distribution of trading volume across different price
levels for each time bar. This is critical for analyzing market structure, identifying
support/resistance zones, and understanding where traders are most active.

Classes:
    GetVbpData: Main class for fetching and processing VBP chart data from Sierra Chart.

Dependencies:
    - trade29.sc: Sierra Chart bridge library for data communication
    - pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library for time-series processing
    - typing: Type hinting support for improved code quality and IDE integration

Example:
    Basic usage of the GetVbpData class:

    ```python
    from sc_py_bridge.get_vbp_chart_data import GetVbpData

    # Initialize with default settings (1M bars, auto bridge creation)
    vbp_fetcher = GetVbpData()

    # Fetch and process VBP data into a DataFrame
    vbp_data = vbp_fetcher.get_vbp_chart_data()

    # Access specific data points
    print(vbp_data['Close'])  # Price data
    print(vbp_data['RVOL'])   # Relative volume indicator
    print(vbp_data['Price'])  # VBP price levels

    # Clean up connection when done
    vbp_fetcher.stop_bridge()
    ```

class GetVbpData:

    Fetch and process Volume by Price (VBP) chart data from Sierra Chart.

    This class manages the complete workflow of retrieving VBP data from Sierra Chart,
    including establishing the bridge connection, requesting historical data with
    specified base data and study indicators, and transforming the nested VBP structure
    into a flat, analysis-ready pandas DataFrame.

    The class handles:
    - Bridge connection management (creation and cleanup)
    - Chart data requests with configurable historical depth
    - VBP data extraction and flattening (nested lists to tabular format)
    - Column normalization and renaming for consistency
    - Integration of price data with volume distribution data

    Attributes:
        bridge (SCBridge): Active connection instance for communicating with Sierra Chart.
            Used to send data requests and receive responses.
        columns_to_drop (List[str]): List of column names to remove from final DataFrame.
            Useful for cleaning up helper columns that aren't needed in analysis.
        historical_bars (int): Number of historical bars to request from Sierra Chart.
            Default is 1,000,000 bars to ensure comprehensive historical coverage.

    Example:
        >>> # Initialize with custom settings
        >>> fetcher = GetVbpData(historical_bars=5000)
        >>> df = fetcher.get_vbp_chart_data()
        >>>
        >>> # Access VBP data
        >>> print(df[['Price', 'TotalVolume', 'Close']].head())
        >>>
        >>> # Cleanup
        >>> fetcher.stop_bridge()

    Note:
        - The bridge connection should be closed with stop_bridge() when done
        - Each bar's VBP data is expanded into multiple rows (one per price level)
        - DateTime index enables easy time-series operations and filtering

        Initialize the GetVbpData instance with configuration parameters.

        allows flexible configuration while providing sensible defaults for common use cases.

        Fetch and process VBP chart data in one complete workflow.

        This is the main public method that orchestrates the complete data pipeline:
        fetching raw data from Sierra Chart and transforming it into an analysis-ready
        DataFrame. This method combines fetch_vbp_chart_data() and process_vbp_chart_data()
        into a single convenient call.

        The complete workflow:
        1. Request chart data from Sierra Chart via the bridge
        2. Receive raw data with nested VBP structure
        3. Flatten VBP data into tabular format
        4. Join VBP with OHLCV and indicator data
        5. Normalize column names and clean up
        6. Return ready-to-use DataFrame

        Returns:
            pd.DataFrame: Fully processed VBP chart data with:
                - DateTime index (may have duplicates for multiple price levels)
                - OHLCV columns (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
                - VBP columns (Price, BidVol, AskVol, TotalVolume, NumOfTrades)
                - Indicator columns (RVOL, TodayOpen/High/Low, LT metrics)
                - Sorted by DateTime and Price for consistent structure

        Raises:
            ConnectionError: If Sierra Chart bridge connection fails.
            ValueError: If data format is invalid or processing fails.
            KeyError: If expected columns are missing from Sierra Chart response.
