"""
Volume by Price (VBP) Chart Data Subscription Module.

This module provides functionality to subscribe to real-time and historical Volume by Price (VBP)
chart data updates from Sierra Chart using the trade29 SC bridge. Unlike the get_vbp_chart_data
module which performs one-time data fetches, this module establishes a persistent subscription
that continuously receives incremental updates as new bars form or complete.

The subscription model is ideal for:
- Real-time trading systems that need continuous market data
- Live monitoring and visualization of market activity
- Event-driven trading strategies that react to price/volume changes
- Streaming data pipelines and live analysis

Classes:
    SubscribeToVbpChartData: Main class for subscribing to and processing VBP chart data updates.

Dependencies:
    - trade29.sc: Sierra Chart bridge library for data communication and subscriptions
    - pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library for time-series processing
    - typing: Type hinting support for improved code quality and IDE integration

Example:
    Basic usage of the SubscribeToVbpChartData class:

    ```python
    from sc_py_bridge.subscribe_to_vbp_chart_data import SubscribeToVbpChartData

    # Initialize with default settings (50 historical bars, updates on bar close)
    subscriber = SubscribeToVbpChartData()

    try:
        # Continuously fetch and process updates
        while True:
            vbp_update_df = subscriber.get_subscribed_vbp_chart_data()
            print(f"New data received: {len(vbp_update_df)} rows")
            print(vbp_update_df.tail(10))

            # Process the update (your trading logic here)
            # analyze_market_data(vbp_update_df)

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Stopping subscription...")
    finally:
        # Clean up connection
        subscriber.stop_bridge()
    ```

class SubscribeToVbpChartData:
    """
    Subscribe to real-time Volume by Price (VBP) chart data updates from Sierra Chart.

    This class manages a persistent subscription to Sierra Chart for continuous VBP data
    updates. Unlike one-time data fetches, a subscription provides an ongoing stream of
    chart data as bars form and complete. The class handles subscription initialization,
    update retrieval from a response queue, and data processing into analysis-ready format.

    The subscription workflow:
    1. Initialize with desired parameters (historical depth, update frequency, etc.)
    2. Automatically establishes subscription and receives initial historical bars
    3. Continuously receives incremental updates as new bars form/complete
    4. Processes each update by flattening VBP structure and normalizing columns
    5. Returns processed data through get_subscribed_vbp_chart_data() method

    Update modes:
    - on_bar_close=True: Updates only when bars complete (default, more stable)
    - on_bar_close=False: Updates on every tick (higher frequency, live data)

    Attributes:
        bridge (SCBridge): Active connection instance for communicating with Sierra Chart.
            Manages the WebSocket/TCP connection and message queue.
        columns_to_drop (List[str]): List of column names to remove from final DataFrame.
            Used to clean up helper columns like 'IsBarClosed'.
        historical_init_bars (int): Number of historical bars sent in initial subscription.
            Provides context for the real-time data. Default is 50 bars.
        realtime_update_bars (int): Number of most recent bars included in each update.
            Usually 1 (just the latest bar), but can be more for analysis. Default is 1.
        on_bar_close (bool): Whether updates are sent only on bar close (True) or
            on every tick (False). True reduces update frequency. Default is True.
        chart_data_id (int): Unique subscription ID assigned by Sierra Chart bridge.
            Used to filter the correct updates from the response queue.

    Example:
        >>> # Real-time monitoring with custom settings
        >>> subscriber = SubscribeToVbpChartData(
        ...     historical_init_bars=100,
        ...     on_bar_close=True
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> # Process updates in a loop
        >>> while True:
        ...     df = subscriber.get_subscribed_vbp_chart_data()
        ...     print(f"Close: {df['Close'].iloc[-1]}")
        ...     print(f"RVOL: {df['RVOL'].iloc[-1]}")
        >>>
        >>> # Cleanup
        >>> subscriber.stop_bridge()

        - Subscription starts automatically in __init__
        - Updates are queued and retrieved with get_subscribed_vbp_chart_data()
        - Always call stop_bridge() to clean up the subscription

        Retrieve the next available chart data update from the subscription queue.

        This method blocks until a new update is available from the Sierra Chart
        subscription, then retrieves it from the response queue, processes it into
        analysis-ready format, and returns it. This is the main method for consuming
        the subscription data stream.

        The method operates in a blocking loop:
        1. Access the bridge's response queue
        2. Wait for next response (blocks if queue is empty)
        3. Check if response matches this subscription's ID
        4. If not a match, discard and continue waiting
        5. If match, convert to DataFrame and process
        6. Return processed data to caller

        This blocking behavior is intentional - it ensures your application processes
        updates in order without missing data or overwhelming the system with polling.

        Returns:
            pd.DataFrame: Processed chart data update with:
                - DateTime index (may have duplicates for multiple price levels)
                - OHLCV columns (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
                - VBP columns (Price, BidVol, AskVol, TotalVolume, NumOfTrades)
                - Indicator columns (RVOL, TodayOpen, TodayHigh, TodayLow)
                - Sorted by DateTime then Price

                First call returns historical_init_bars for context.
                Subsequent calls return realtime_update_bars (typically 1 bar).

        Raises:
            KeyboardInterrupt: If user interrupts with Ctrl+C (propagates up).
            Exception: If queue retrieval or processing fails.

        Example:
            >>> subscriber = SubscribeToVbpChartData()
            >>>
            >>> # Process first update (historical context)
            >>> initial_data = subscriber.get_subscribed_vbp_chart_data()
            >>> print(f"Initial bars: {len(initial_data)}")
            >>>

            ...     update = subscriber.get_subscribed_vbp_chart_data()
