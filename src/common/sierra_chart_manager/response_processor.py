"""
Response Processor for Sierra Chart Data.

This module processes responses from different Sierra Chart subscription types
and prepares them for the data pipeline and ML components.

The processor handles the transformation from raw Sierra Chart responses to
analysis-ready DataFrames, keeping this logic separate from subscription
management and model inference.

    Processes responses from Sierra Chart subscriptions.

    This class handles the transformation of raw SC responses into clean,
    analysis-ready DataFrames. It separates data transformation logic from
    subscription management and business logic.

    Different response types (VBP, account, position) have different processing
    requirements, all handled through this unified interface.

    Attributes:
        None - stateless processor

    Example:
        >>> processor = ResponseProcessor()

        >>> # Process VBP response
        >>> vbp_df = processor.process_vbp_response(response)

        Process a VBP chart data response into a DataFrame.

        This method handles the transformation from Sierra Chart's VBP
        response format to a clean, flattened DataFrame ready for feature
        engineering and analysis.

        The processing is delegated to the SubscribeToVbpChartData class's
        process_vbp_chart_data method, which handles:
        - Flattening nested VBP structure
        - Normalizing column names
        - Sorting by DateTime and Price
        - Joining with OHLCV and indicator data

        Args:
            response: Raw response from Sierra Chart VBP subscription.
                Expected to have .as_df() method that returns DataFrame.

        Returns:
            pd.DataFrame: Processed DataFrame with columns:
                - DateTime index (may have duplicates for multiple price levels)
                - OHLCV: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
                - VBP: Price, BidVol, AskVol, TotalVolume, NumOfTrades
                - Indicators: RVOL, TodayOpen, TodayHigh, TodayLow

        Example:
            >>> processor = ResponseProcessor()
            >>> df = processor.process_vbp_response(response)
            >>> print(df.columns)
